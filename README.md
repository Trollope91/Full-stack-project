a wishlist that the user can save specific products too and a bag/checkout that will calculate the total of the purchase, workout whether it qualifies for free delivery and then handles creditcard payments

## Wireframes

I used balsamiq to create the initial wireframes.

### Database

I opted for ElephantSQL, a relational database built on PostgreSQL, over MongoDB due to the structured nature of my data and project requirements. ElephantSQL's relational model supports clear data relationships, complex queries, and ensures ACID compliance, making it suitable for scenarios where data integrity and consistency are paramount. The mature ecosystem and scalability of PostgreSQL further align with the needs of my application, contributing to a robust and reliable database solution.

### Colors

Main colours used in the project:

hex#345171 in the background image of the home

hex#800080 for the navbar accents and logo

### Images

-   Imagery used in the project was either pulled from real sources for products or produced by myself such as the backdrop to the home page

# Testing

## Testing

Full details of testing can be found [here](TESTING.md).

# Deployment

I used Gitpod as a development environment where I committed all changes to git version control system.

The application was deployed to heroku for the live site.

## Github Repository

https://github.com/Trollope91/Full-stack-project


## Copying the repository

A user can make a local copy of my repository by going to the GitHub repository page of my project and clicking on the "Code" button which will open a dropdown menu, select the protocol (HTTPS or SSH) for the clone URL and copy it to the clipboard.

Open a terminal on their local machine and navigate to the directory where they want to store the project then type the command "git clone" followed by the URL they copied in step 3, and press Enter.
Wait for the cloning process to complete.

Git will start cloning the repository onto your local machine. Depending on the size of the repository and your internet connection, this may take a moment.

Once the cloning process is complete, you will have a local copy of the GitHub repository in the directory you specified

## Forking the repository

To fork the repository the user can go to the GitHub repository page of the project and click on the "Fork" button in the upper right-hand corner of the page, select the account they want to fork the project to and then wait for GitHub to create a copy of the project in their account.
Once the fork is complete the project will be available under their account with the option to clone to their local machine.
